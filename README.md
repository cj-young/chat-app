## üëâ Getting Started

Currently, this project is not hosted, so you must clone this repository and run the dev server locally.

### üõ†Ô∏è Services Used

#### MongoDB

This project uses MongoDB to store data. To run it locally, you must have an available cluster.

#### Google Authentication

For Google Authentication to work, you must have a project in your [Google Cloud Console]("http://console.cloud.google.com"). To learn how to set up authentication, read [this guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)

#### Pusher

Pusher provides websocket connections separate from the Next.js server. You will need to create an account and retrieve necessary app keys required in the environment variables. Click [here](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/getting_started/javascript/#get-your-free-api-keys) to learn more.

#### Firebase Cloud Storage

To store non-text media, Firebase Cloud Storage is used. To learn how to set up Cloud Storage, read [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start).
